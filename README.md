# LanguageInterpreter
Programming Lab - First Project - Basic Language Interpreter 

Date: ***April 6th 2019***

### Compile:

	gcc -o t1 trab1.c main.c

### Run:

	./t1
  
  > **or**
  ```bash
  ./t1 < <EXAMPLES_FILE>*
  ```
 *(example files like **input.txt** may be used)*
 
Please check ***info.txt*** to check accepted syntax. Make sure every instruction and special character is separated by a space.

Please make sure that the file you use is in the same directory as the rest of the implementation.
  
The program will keep expecting input until the instruction ***quit ;*** is given.

If specific input values for variables in ***ler ( var ) ;*** are necessary, the program will ask for them after the ***quit ;*** instruction.
